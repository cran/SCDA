\arguments{
\item{Formula}{a symbolic description of the regression model to be fit. The details of model specification are given for \code{lm(...)}}

\item{Data_sf}{A \code{data.frame} object of class \code{sf} with n rows (each one corresponding to a location/polygon) and a user-defined number of columns.
The data frame must contain the response variable and all the covariates to be used in the model. Also, it must include the \code{geometry} feature for spatial modelling and representation.
Typically, \code{sf} \code{data.frame} are built using the \code{st_as_sf(...)} command from the \code{sf} package (see its documentation for details).}

\item{listW}{\code{listw} object. It contains the spatial weights for the spatial autoregressive component.
Typically, listW is built using the \code{nb2listw(...)} command from the \code{spdep} package (see its documentation for details).
We suggest to adopt one of matrix styles suggested in the \code{spdep} package, such as \code{W} (row-standardized) or \code{B} (binary).
We also suggest to adopt a \code{zero.policy = TRUE} option to allow the computation of groups/clusters with isolated units. In this regard, we recall that if \code{zero.policy = FALSE} and \code{Type = "SCSAR"} causes \code{SCSR_Estim(...)} to terminate with an error.
See package \code{spatialreg} for details on the \code{zero.policy} input.}

\item{Phi.set}{Non-negative (>=0) real-valued vector. Sequence of spatial penalty parameter. Default is \code{Phi = c(0.50,1)}.}

\item{G.set}{Integer vector. Sequence of clusters to be considered. Default is \code{G = c(2,3,4)}.}

\item{Type}{Character. Declares which model specification has to be estimated. Admitted strings are:
\itemize{
 \item{\code{"SCLM"} for linear regression model without spatial effects (LM);}
 \item{\code{"SCSAR"} for spatial autoregressive (SAR) model;}
 \item{\code{"SCSEM"} for linear regression model with spatial autoregressive error term or spatial Durbin model (SEM);}
 \item{\code{"SCSLX"} for linear regression model with spatially-lagged response variable and covariates (SLX);}
}}

\item{CenterVars}{\code{Logical} value (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}) stating whether the response variable and the covariates have to be centered around the mean in the iterative algorithm to update memberships and group-wise parameters.
Centering is only use in the iterative procedure, while final estimates provided to the user are computed original (i.e., non-centered) variables.}

\item{ScaleVars}{\code{Logical} value (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}) stating whether the response variable and the covariates have to be scaled with respect to their standard deviation in the iterative algorithm to update memberships and group-wise parameters.
Scaling is only used in the iterative procedure, while final estimates provided to the user are computed original (i.e., non-scaled) variables.}

\item{Maxitr}{Integer value. Maximum number of iterations for the iterative algorithm. Convergence criterion is fixed to  \eqn{\varepsilon} = 10^(-5).}

\item{RelTol}{Tolerance for the relative improvement in the log-likelihood (exit criterion) from iteration k to k+1. Default is \eqn{\varepsilon_{Rel}} = 10^-6}

\item{AbsTol}{Tolerance for the absolute improvement in the log-likelihood (exit criterion) from iteration k to k+1. Default is \eqn{\varepsilon_{Abs}} = 10^-5}

\item{Verbose}{\code{Logical} value (\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}). Toggle warnings and messages. If \code{verbose = TRUE} (default) the function
prints on the screen some messages describing the progress of the tasks. If \code{verbose = FALSE} any message about the progression is suppressed.}

\item{Seed}{Integer value. Define the random number generator (RNG) state for random number generation in R.
Deafult is \code{seed = 123456789}.}
}
\value{
A list object containing the following outputs:
\itemize{
\item{IC: a \code{data.frame} object containing one row for each combination of the supplied vectors G.set and Phi.set and 5 columns (G,Phi,AIC,BIC,HQC).}
\item{OptimPars: a \code{data.frame} object with 3 rows (criteria) and 2 columns (Parameters) with the optimal combination of G and Phi for every criterion.}
}
}
\description{
Computes the likelihood-based information criteria (i.e, Akaike's IC, Bayesian IC, and Hannanâ€“Quinn IC) for every SCSR model given by the combination of the G and Phi contained in the \code{G.set} and \code{Phi.set} inputs and provides the associated likelihood-based information criteria.
Given the minimization rule, \code{SCSR_InfoCrit} automatically identifies the optimal number of clusters for every criterion.
}
\details{
Given the vectors G.set = c(2,3,4) and Phi.set = c(0.50,1), the function 'SCSR_InfoCrit' will compute 3x2=6 models, each at a given combination of G and Phi.
